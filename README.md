3D Scene with OpenGL / CS 445: Computer Graphics

Group project for CS445
We researched, designed, and developed a simple 3d scene with OpenGL, a library provided by Java. 
The project was used to demonstrate different aspects of graphics like texture mapping, lighting, visible surface detection, and surface rendering.

Added extra functionalities such as full screen, audio incorporated, and frame counter.
